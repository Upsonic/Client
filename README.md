## Features

- Easy serialization of functions and classes, making them readily available for reuse across different projects.
- Automatic documentation generation for effortless maintenance and readability.
- Support for both direct and modular function importation from the library.
- Streamlined version control and collaboration features, allowing teams to work together seamlessly.

### Easiest Library View
Usponic proveides an dashboard for your team members. Everyone can access to the dashboard by their [user status](https://docs.upsonic.co/on-prem/using/users). After the accessing they can easily view the top libraries and automaticaly generated connections codes.

### Automaticaly Documentation
In Upsonic On-Prem dashboard we have automaticaly generated documentation for your each function, class, object or variables. For this you can use OpenAI GPT integration or a self-hosted Google Gemma model in your installation. They are making your documentations automaticaly. Also you can easily search your content.

## Installation

You need to install the Upsonic container.

[Installing and Running On-Prem Container](https://docs.upsonic.co/on-prem/getting_started/install_on_prem)

Once the container is up and running, you can install the Upsonic Python Client Library on your local system using the pip package manager:
```console
# pip install upsonic
```



## Usage

Upsonic streamlines the development and deployment of utility libraries. Here's how to get started:

### Basic Usage

1. Initialize Upsonic with your server's address:
   ```python
   from upsonic import Upsonic_On_Prem
   upsonic = Upsonic_On_Prem('https://your-server-address:5000', 'ACK_****************')
   ```

2. Define a function you wish to serialize and share:
   ```python
   def sum(a, b):
       return a + b
   ```

3. Serialize the function for Upsonic:
   ```python
   upsonic.dump("math.basics.sum", sum)
   ```

4. Import and use the serialized function in another project:
   ```python
   math = upsonic.load_module("math")
   math.basics.sum(5, 2)
   ```

### Advanced Usage

For complex scenarios and advanced usage, refer to our [detailed documentation](https://docs.upsonic.co/home).

```python
from upsonic import Upsonic_On_Prem
upsonic = Upsonic_On_Prem('https://your-server-address:5000', 'ACK_****************')



def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

upsonic.dump("math.basics.sum", sum)



math = upsonic.load_module("math")

math.basics.sum(5, 2)
```
